# Bootstrap 4

### What's New?
- With version 4, Boostrap has moved from LESS to Sass. Sass lets you customize and override certain things in Boostrap like colors and breakpoints.
- The default font measurement has been changed from `px` to `rem`, and the root font size is back up to 16.
- The introduction of **Reboot**, which is a normalizing template, to make sure your site looks the same across all browsers.
